# Incident Response Design for SafeBank

## Introduction

SafeBank's Incident Response Design is for detecting, mitigating, and preventing issues in real time to uphold reliability, security, and customer trust. Utilizing Azure's monitoring suite and automated workflows, the strategy ensures that incidents are resolved swiftly with minimal impact on operations.

## Objectives

1. Minimize Service Downtime:
   - Ensure adherence to SLA guarantees of 99% uptime by implementing automated failovers and resource scaling
   - Focus on critical paths such as transaction processing, API performance, and database reliability

2. Maintain Security and Compliance:
   - Meet the SLA's 100% compliance with encryption standards for data at rest and in transit
   - Prioritize the detection and mitigation of security breaches using Azure Security Center

3. Efficient Communication:
   - Streamline incident communication through Slack and ITSM tools to ensure teams and stakeholders are updated on incident status
   - Categorize incidents by severity to determine the escalation hierarchy

4. Proactive Mitigation:
   - Leverage historical incident trends from Azure Workbooks to identify recurring patterns
   - Deploy preemptive measures, such as enhanced autoscaling and pre-tested deployment pipelines, to reduce future risks

## Incident Response Workflow

### 1. Detection

- Tools: Utilize Azure Monitor, Application Insights, and Log Analytics for real-time detection
- Key Metrics:
  - Uptime percentage below 99%
  - CPU utilization exceeding 80%
  - Transaction processing times exceeding 2 seconds for 99% of transactions
  - API error rates above 1%
- Triggers: Predefined thresholds set for SLIs automatically activate alerts
- Example Detection Case:
  - An Application Insights metric detects an API error rate spike due to a misconfigured deployment

### 2. Alert Notification

- Slack Integration:
  - Alerts automatically post to predefined Slack channels (e.g., #security-concerns) via Azure Logic Apps
  - Each alert contains details: description, severity, timestamp, and direct links to diagnostic logs


### 3. Incident Analysis

- Log Analysis: Teams investigate logs from Azure Log Analytics to identify root causes
- Correlation Tools: Application Insights provides correlated diagnostics, connecting performance issues to specific deployments or code changes
- Deep-Dive Example:
  - Scenario: High CPU usage on virtual machines hosting the application backend
  - Analysis: Logs show the spike occurred after a sudden increase in traffic during a marketing campaign, and the current scaling configuration was insufficient

### 4. Resolution

- Automated Responses:
  - Scaling Resources: Trigger Azure Autoscale to add instances for load balancing
  - Service Restarts: Automatically restart unresponsive services using Logic Apps workflows
- Manual Interventions:
  - Developers debug the identified root cause using Azure DevOps integrated logs
  - Critical issues trigger rollback procedures through CI/CD pipelines to revert to the last stable version
- Resolution Example:
  - A failed database query causes transaction delays. The database team optimizes the query and adds indexes to restore normal operations

### 5. Post-Incident Review

- Incident Reports:
  - Use Azure Workbooks to generate detailed reports, covering metrics like downtime duration, affected users, and root causes
- Stakeholder Communication:
  - Weekly updates sent to stakeholders, summarizing incidents and resolutions
- Preventive Measures:
  - Document fixes in incident playbooks
  - Update monitoring thresholds if necessary

## Roles and Responsibilities for Incident Response

### Cloud Architect

- Evaluate cloud-specific issues during incidents, such as regional Azure service disruptions or resource failures
- Provide technical input on incident resolution for infrastructure scalability and redundancy
- Ensure the cloud environment complies with best practices during and after the resolution process

### Infrastructure Developer

- Respond to infrastructure-related alerts (e.g., high CPU usage, resource saturation) and resolve incidents involving misconfigured or under-provisioned resources
- Use Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) to deploy fixes or additional resources as needed during incidents
- Configure Azure Monitor alerts and ensure logs are correctly routed to the monitoring tools and Slack

### Full Stack Developer

- Investigate application-level incidents, including bugs, API errors, or degraded frontend/backend performance
- Develop and deploy quick patches or hotfixes to mitigate the user impact during an incident
- Ensure application logs provide actionable insights by integrating them with Azure Application Insights

### Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

- Act as the incident commander, coordinating the response across teams to ensure efficient resolution
- Ensure SLA and SLO compliance by monitoring incident metrics, such as Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)
- Automate response workflows using Azure Logic Apps to trigger alerts, scale resources, or reroute traffic
- Facilitate post-incident reviews to document the root cause, impact analysis, and preventive measures

### Product Owner

- Determine the business impact of incidents and prioritize resolution efforts based on user and business needs
- Communicate updates to stakeholders and users during high-severity incidents
- Collaborate with the technical teams to review post-incident findings and ensure long-term improvements are implemented

## Integration with Monitoring and Communication Tools

### 1. Azure Logic Apps for Incident Automation

- Connect Azure alerts to Logic Apps to automate responses and Slack notifications
- Automate recurring actions, such as restarting services or scaling resources

### 2. ITSM Integration

- Alerts are automatically routed to ITSM platforms to create actionable tickets
- Include enriched context such as affected services, severity, and logs

### 3. Slack Integration

- Workflow Example:
  - Alert triggered → Logic App posts details in Slack → Incident Manager reviews and assigns tasks
- Enable real-time collaboration by linking to dashboards, metrics, and logs

## Metrics for Measuring Incident Response

1. Mean Time to Detect (MTTD):
   - Measure how quickly an issue is identified post-occurrence
   - Target: Under 2 minutes

2. Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA):
   - Assess the response team's speed in acknowledging alerts
   - Target: Under 5 minutes

3. Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR):
   - Calculate the total time taken to fully resolve incidents
   - Target: Under 30 minutes for high-severity incidents

4. Escalation Effectiveness:
   - Monitor the success rate of incident escalations to ensure they are routed to the right teams

## Incident Response Example: API Failure

1. Detection:
   - API error rate exceeds the threshold of 1%, Azure Monitor triggers an alert

2. Notification:
   - The alert posts to the #security-concerns Slack channel and creates a ServiceNow ticket

3. Analysis:
   - Log Analytics identifies that a recent deployment introduced a misconfigured API endpoint

4. Resolution:
   - The CI/CD pipeline automatically rolls back the deployment. The development team fixes the issue and redeploys

5. Review:
   - Root cause documented, and future deployments are updated with enhanced validation tests

## Conclusion

This Incident Response Design aligns with SafeBank's SLA, SLOs, and Monitoring Strategy by defining proactive and reactive measures, clear responsibilities, and actionable workflows. This is made to ensure that SafeBank maintains its operational responsibilities and high user trust, even in the face of unexpected disruptions.
