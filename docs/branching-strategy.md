## Git Feature Branching Strategy 🌳

- **Github Branch Protection Rules** 🔒

  - Require a pull request before merging to `main`
  - Require at least one code review approval before merging
  - Ensure passing status checks from CI pipelines before integration

- **Feature Branches**

  - Use short-lived feature branches for developing bug fixes and new features
  - Maintain mutual agreement among the team on branch naming conventions and processes to avoid confusion and conflicts

- **Collaboration and Communication** 🧑‍💻👩‍💻
  - Constant communication among developers
  - Frequent check-ins with `main`
