# Scrum Methodology

This section outlines the Scrum methodology adopted for the SafeBank project, detailing the processes, roles, and events that contributed to its success. Below is an overview of our strategy, followed by a detailed breakdown of key elements like the Product Backlog, Sprint Planning and Execution, and Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives.

## 1. Overview of Our Scrum Strategy

The SafeBank project was managed using the Scrum Framework, emphasizing iterative delivery and team collaboration. Key components of our Scrum strategy included:

- **Roles and Responsibilities**: 
  - The project team consisted of a Product Owner, Scrum Master, and a cross-functional Development Team.

- **Artifacts**:
  - The Product Backlog served as the primary source of requirements, while the Sprint Backlog guided sprint-specific activities.

- **Events**: 
  - The project was executed through structured Scrum ceremonies:
    - **Sprint Planning**: To define sprint goals and tasks. (Details in Section 3.)
    - **Daily Stand-ups**: To ensure ongoing alignment.
    - **Sprint Reviews and Retrospectives**: To gather feedback and improve processes. (Details in Section 4.)

This structured approach ensured continuous progress, adaptability to changing requirements, and alignment with stakeholder expectations.

## 2. Product Backlog

The Product Backlog served as the backbone of the SafeBank project's Scrum process, containing all features, requirements, fixes, and technical tasks. This centralized artifact ensured that the entire team maintained a shared understanding of project goals and priorities.

### 2.1 Ownership and Collaboration

- **The Product Owner**:
  - Held primary responsibility for the Product Backlog, ensuring it reflected business needs and stakeholder expectations.

- **Collaboration with the Cloud Architect**:
  - The Product Owner worked closely with the Cloud Architect to translate high-level business requirements into technical tasks. This collaboration ensured the backlog included:
    - Functional user stories (e.g., "As a user, I can view my transaction history").
    - Non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, security, and performance).
    - Technical tasks (e.g., "Set up a CI/CD pipeline for deployment").

- **Stakeholder Engagement**:
  - The Product Owner facilitated regular discussions with stakeholders to gather feedback and refine backlog priorities.

### 2.2 Structure and Organization

- **User Stories**:
  - Each item in the backlog was crafted as a user story with the help of the Cloud Architect, adhering to the format:
    - As a [user role], I want to [achieve a goal], so that [business value is delivered].
    - Example: "As a bank manager, I want to generate account reports, so that I can analyze customer trends."

- **Prioritization**:
  - Items were ranked based on their business value, technical feasibility, and dependencies. High-priority items (e.g., core banking features) were addressed first.

- **Backlog Grooming**:
  - Regular sessions were held involving the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team to refine and clarify backlog items.
  - Complex user stories were broken into smaller, manageable tasks to ensure a smooth workflow during sprints.

### 2.3 Processes and Tools

- **Dynamic Updates**:
  - The Product Backlog evolved continuously, with updates made after Sprint Reviews, Retrospectives, and stakeholder meetings.

- **Technical Debt Management**:
  - Items addressing technical debt were added to the backlog to ensure long-term system maintainability.

- **Cloud-Native Considerations**:
  - The Cloud Architect contributed to backlog refinement by identifying requirements related to infrastructure, scalability, and cloud service configurations.
  - Example: Tasks like "Implement auto-scaling policies on AWS" were added based on technical analysis.

- **Tool Usage**:
  - The team used Azure DevOps to manage the Product Backlog. The tool allowed for:
    - Visualizing the backlog as a prioritized list.
    - Adding detailed descriptions, attachments, and comments to each item.
    - Assigning backlog items to specific team members for accountability.

### 2.4 Key Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**:
  - The Product Backlog centralized all project requirements, ensuring that the team was always aligned on what needed to be done and why.

- **Alignment of Business and Technical Goals**:
  - By involving both the Product Owner and the Cloud Architect, the backlog bridged the gap between business requirements and technical execution.

- **Flexibility and Adaptability**:
  - Dynamic updates to the backlog allowed the team to respond quickly to changing requirements, ensuring that the product remained relevant to user needs.

## 3. Sprint Planning and Execution

Each sprint began with a Sprint Planning Meeting to define the scope of work and ensure team alignment. Key activities during this phase included:

### 3.1 Sprint Planning

- **Goal Setting**:
  - The team collaborated to select high-priority items from the Product Backlog and define the Sprint Goal.

- **Task Breakdown**:
  - Each backlog item was broken into manageable tasks with clear ownership and deadlines.

- **Commitment**:
  - The team committed to delivering a realistic subset of items within the sprint's timeframe.

### 3.2 Sprint Execution

- **Daily Stand-ups**:
  - These short, focused meetings kept the team aligned. Each member shared updates on:
    - What they accomplished the previous day.
    - What they planned to do that day.
    - Any blockers needing attention.

- **Collaboration**:
  - Continuous communication within the team helped address challenges and ensure smooth progress.

- **Increment Delivery**:
  - At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product increment was delivered, providing tangible value to stakeholders.

## 4. Sprint Review and Retrospective

### 4.1 Sprint Review

- **Stakeholder Involvement**:
  - At the end of each sprint, the team conducted a Sprint Review to demonstrate the increment to stakeholders.
  - Stakeholders provided feedback on delivered features.

- **Alignment**:
  - Feedback was used to adjust the Product Backlog and prioritize upcoming work.

- **Transparency**:
  - The review showcased the team's progress and reinforced trust between the team and stakeholders.

### 4.2 Sprint Retrospective

- **Reflection Topics**:
  - Discussions focused on:
    - What went well.
    - What didn't go as planned.
    - Opportunities for improvement.

- **Actionable Outcomes**:
  - The team identified concrete steps to enhance workflows and efficiency for future sprints.

These ceremonies fostered continuous improvement and ensured the team remained adaptive and motivated.
