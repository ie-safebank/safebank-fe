### **2. Security**
**Ensuring secure access and protecting sensitive data.**

- **Collaborator**: Cybersecurity Engineer

SafeBank employs robust security measures to protect its systems and data, leveraging tools and best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.

#### **Key Implementations**
1. **Secret Management**:
   - Configured **GitHub Secret Scanning** and **Push Protection** to prevent accidental inclusion of sensitive data in repositories.
   - Secured **Container Registry** and **PostgreSQL credentials** in **Azure Key Vault**.

2. **Code and Dependency Security**:
   - Implemented **CodeQL** for automated vulnerability detection in frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Python) code.
   - Enabled **Dependabot** for dependency updates and **Dependency Reviews** to assess security risks.

3. **Access Control**:
   - Used **CODEOWNERS** to ensure domain experts review critical code changes.
   - Applied **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit resource access to authorized personnel.

4. **Security Posture Improvement**:
   - Integrated **OSSF Scorecard** to enhance repository security practices.


#### **Security Workflow**

| **Workflow**              | **Description**                                                                                     |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Code Scanning**          | CodeQL scans are triggered on every pull request and commit to identify vulnerabilities proactively. |
| **Dependency Management**  | Dependabot monitors dependencies and automatically submits pull requests for updates.              |
| **Secret Management**      | Push Protection prevents secrets from being committed. Alerts for bypasses are reviewed promptly.  |

### **3. Performance Efficiency**
**Optimizing resources to handle varying workloads efficiently.**

- **Collaborators**: Site Reliability Engineer & Infrastructure Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Azure Static Websites**:
    - The globally distributed **Azure CDN** delivers frontend content with minimal latency.
  - **Scalable Backend**:
    - Backend services are containerized and hosted on **Azure App Services**, configured with auto-scaling rules to handle traffic spikes dynamically.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**:
    - Integrated **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** provide real-time insights into system performance, identifying areas for improvement.
  - **Load Testing**:
    - Regular load tests validate backend scaling mechanisms and ensure the frontend can handle concurrent user requests.

---

### **4. Operational Excellence**
**Streamlining processes and improving operational workflows.**

- **Collaborator**: Full Stack Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
    - Automated CI/CD pipelines streamline deployments for both infrastructure and application code.
  - **Observability**:
    - Logging and telemetry data from **Application Insights** aid in debugging and improving service delivery.
  - **Documentation and Modularity**:
    - Modular **Bicep templates** simplify infrastructure updates and enable clear resource management.
  - **Proactive Alerts**:
    - Alerts from **Azure Monitor** keep the team informed about potential issues, reducing time-to-resolution.

---

### **5. Cost Optimization**
**Minimizing costs without compromising quality or performance.**

- **Collaborator**: Infrastructure Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Pay-as-you-Go Model**:
    - Resources like Azure Static Web Apps and App Services are billed based on usage, ensuring no idle costs.
  - **Azure Resource Management**:
    - Modular **Bicep templates** deploy only the necessary resources, avoiding over-provisioning.
  - **Cost Monitoring**:
    - Azure Monitor tracks resource utilization, helping identify opportunities to optimize spending.
  - **Autoscaling**:
    - Backend auto-scaling ensures resources are allocated dynamically, saving costs during low traffic periods.
