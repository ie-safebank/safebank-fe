## üìñ **Design Decisions for Each Pillar**

### **1. Reliability**
**Ensuring service continuity even during failures.**

- **Collaborator**: Site Reliability Engineer
- **Key Principles**:
  - CI/CD pipelines automate deployments using **GitHub Actions**, minimizing human error and enabling consistent updates.
  - **Redundancy**:
    - Azure PostgreSQL Database supports automated backups and **geo-replication** for high availability.
    - Backend services are containerized, isolating faults and allowing scalable recovery.
  - **Monitoring**:
    - **Application Insights** continuously tracks frontend and backend performance.
    - Alerts for performance bottlenecks enable proactive issue resolution.
  - **Testing for Reliability**:
    - Regular chaos engineering simulations validate the system's ability to handle unexpected failures.

### **2. Security**
**Protecting sensitive data and ensuring secure access.**

- **Collaborator**: Cybersecurity Engineer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Key Vault Integration**:
    - Azure Key Vault secures sensitive credentials (e.g., database keys, API tokens).
    - All secrets are accessed securely via CI/CD workflows, ensuring no credentials are exposed in repositories.
  - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - Resource permissions are defined using **Azure RBAC**, ensuring only authorized personnel can access critical systems.
  - **Encryption**:
    - Data at rest is encrypted using Azure-managed keys, while **TLS** encrypts data in transit.
  - **Secure Deployment**:
    - Backend and frontend deployments follow secure workflows, using secrets managed by Azure Key Vault.

### **3. Performance Efficiency**
**Optimizing resources to handle varying workloads efficiently.**

- **Collaborators**: Site Reliability Engineer & Infrastructure Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Azure Static Websites**:
    - The globally distributed **Azure CDN** delivers frontend content with minimal latency.
  - **Scalable Backend**:
    - Backend services are containerized and hosted on **Azure App Services**, configured with auto-scaling rules to handle traffic spikes dynamically.
  - **Continuous Monitoring**:
    - Integrated **Azure Monitor** and **Application Insights** provide real-time insights into system performance, identifying areas for improvement.
  - **Load Testing**:
    - Regular load tests validate backend scaling mechanisms and ensure the frontend can handle concurrent user requests.

---

### **4. Operational Excellence**
**Streamlining processes and improving operational workflows.**

- **Collaborator**: Full Stack Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
    - Automated CI/CD pipelines streamline deployments for both infrastructure and application code.
  - **Observability**:
    - Logging and telemetry data from **Application Insights** aid in debugging and improving service delivery.
  - **Documentation and Modularity**:
    - Modular **Bicep templates** simplify infrastructure updates and enable clear resource management.
  - **Proactive Alerts**:
    - Alerts from **Azure Monitor** keep the team informed about potential issues, reducing time-to-resolution.

---

### **5. Cost Optimization**
**Minimizing costs without compromising quality or performance.**

- **Collaborator**: Infrastructure Developer
- **Key Principles**:
  - **Pay-as-you-Go Model**:
    - Resources like Azure Static Web Apps and App Services are billed based on usage, ensuring no idle costs.
  - **Azure Resource Management**:
    - Modular **Bicep templates** deploy only the necessary resources, avoiding over-provisioning.
  - **Cost Monitoring**:
    - Azure Monitor tracks resource utilization, helping identify opportunities to optimize spending.
  - **Autoscaling**:
    - Backend auto-scaling ensures resources are allocated dynamically, saving costs during low traffic periods.
