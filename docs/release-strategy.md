## 2. Goals of the Release Strategy

- **Deliver Value Faster:** Ensuring that features reach production quickly through automated pipelines.
- **Optimize Quality:** Embedding quality checks at every stage of development to reduce errors and improve system performance.
- **Maximize Security:** Preventing vulnerabilities and protecting sensitive data using advanced DevSecOps practices.
- **Scale with Confidence:** Designing a release system that adapts to SafeBank’s growing user base and evolving business needs.

## 3. Environment Design

Our release strategy adopts a DTAP (Development, Testing, Acceptance, Production) model. Each environment is tailored to specific stages of the software lifecycle to ensure seamless transitions and robust validations.

### 3.1. Development Environment (DEV)

- **Purpose:** Supports feature development and testing by developers.
- **Why It Works:** Early experimentation ensures developers can identify and resolve issues before code is promoted.
- **Key Features:**
  - Hosted in the `SAFEBANK-DEV` Azure resource group with contributor permissions.
  - Automated CI/CD workflows trigger builds and deployments to this environment after every feature branch push.
  - Integrated with Azure Monitor to capture metrics and logs, ensuring developers receive immediate feedback.

### 3.2. Testing/UAT Environment (UAT)

- **Purpose:** Acts as a staging environment for final validation by stakeholders.
- **Why It Works:** Mimics production, providing stakeholders confidence in the release’s stability.
- **Key Features:**
  - Hosted in the `SAFEBANK-UAT` resource group with reader permissions.
  - Deployments triggered by pull request merges to the main branch.
  - Incorporates Postman functional tests and integration tests.
  - Enables stakeholder feedback loops, aligned with DORA’s "Lead Time for Changes" metric.

### 3.3. Production Environment (PROD)

- **Purpose:** Houses the final, stable version for end-users.
- **Why It Works:** Ensures high availability and performance for users while enabling safe rollouts.
- **Key Features:**
  - Hosted in the `SAFEBANK-PROD` resource group.
  - Deployments are subject to Canary Rollout policies for risk minimization.
  - Integrated with monitoring tools like Azure Application Insights to maintain a robust incident response system.

### 3.4. Environment-Specific Configurations

- **Frontend:** Deployed as a static web app (Vue.js) via Azure Static Web Apps for cost efficiency.
- **Backend:** Hosted using Linux-based Azure App Service for scalable and containerized deployments.
- **Database:** Azure PostgreSQL with encryption and access policies.
- **Secrets:** Managed in Azure Key Vault, ensuring secure storage and rotation of credentials.
- **Monitoring:** Unified with a single Azure Monitor workspace to reduce overhead and centralize observability.

## 4. Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline

SafeBank’s CI/CD pipeline ensures streamlined, automated software delivery while emphasizing quality, security, and efficiency.

### 4.1. Feature Branching Strategy

- **Why This Matters:** Enables parallel development, reducing conflicts and promoting innovation.
- **Implementation:**
  - Feature branches are short-lived, ensuring frequent merges.
  - Developers push changes to feature branches, triggering builds, tests, and deployments to the DEV environment.

### 4.2. Main Branch Protection

- **Why This Matters:** Guarantees stability in production and aligns with DORA’s "Change Failure Rate" metric.
- **Policies:**
  - Minimum of two reviewers per PR.
  - Automated status checks for tests, linting, and security scans.
  - No direct pushes to main, enforcing proper review and testing.

### 4.3. Deployment Workflows

- **Why This Matters:** Automated pipelines eliminate manual errors, shorten delivery cycles, and reduce lead times.
- **Process:**
  - **Development (DEV):** Builds and tests triggered on every feature branch push.
  - **Testing/UAT:** Functional tests validate code quality in UAT upon PR merges.
  - **Production (PROD):** Canary deployments allow phased rollouts, with automated rollback for issues.

### 4.4. Key CI/CD Advantages

- Automated testing ensures that code is validated at every stage, reducing defect introduction.
- Integration with GitHub Actions provides robust pipelines and logs for debugging.

## 5. DevSecOps Practices

SafeBank’s security-first approach integrates DevSecOps principles across every stage of development and deployment.

### 5.1. Secrets Management

- **Why It Matters:** Prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive data.
- **Implementation:**
  - Credentials (API keys, DB passwords) are securely stored in Azure Key Vault.
  - Azure Key Vault integrates seamlessly with GitHub Actions using Service Principals, ensuring secure, automated access during CI/CD.

### 5.2. Code Security

- **Why It Matters:** Proactively identifies vulnerabilities, reducing the likelihood of production incidents.
- **Implementation:**
  - CodeQL scans the frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Python) for vulnerabilities.
  - Push Protection prevents secrets from being pushed to repositories.
  - Dependency Reviews highlight the impact of library changes on security.

### 5.3. Dependency Security

- **Why It Matters:** Keeps SafeBank up-to-date with the latest features and patches.
- **Implementation:**
  - Automated updates managed by Dependabot.
  - Security audits performed for each dependency.

## 6. Monitoring and Incident Management

SafeBank’s monitoring strategy ensures system health, supports continuous improvement, and enhances decision-making.

### 6.1. Monitoring Tools

- **Azure Monitor:** Tracks resource performance, availability, and errors.
- **Log Analytics Workspace:** Centralized logging for cross-environment analysis.
- **Application Insights:** Captures telemetry data for frontend and backend.

### 6.2. SLOs and SLIs

- **Why It Matters:** Establishes clear performance objectives and actionable insights.

### 6.3. Incident Response

- **Why It Matters:** Ensures quick recovery and minimal disruption.
- **Implementation:**
  - Integrated Slack ChatOps for real-time alerts and resolution tracking.
  - Incident reports analyzed for continuous improvement.
