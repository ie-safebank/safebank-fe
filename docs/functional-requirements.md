Regular collaboration between **Karl (Product Owner)** and **Clara (Cloud Architect)** ensured that user needs remained the focal point of the design process. The requirements were frequently revisited and adapted based on the team’s capacity and evolving decisions, striking a balance between functionality, scalability, and feasibility.
